# Egg Game

Egg-flavoured video game.

Simulation/adventure game made with Bevy. A work-in-progress.

Originally a [TIC-80 game](http://tic80.com/play?cart=3193) using the Rust bindings to the WASM API, but I hit the 80kb memory limit ðŸ¤·. Ported to Bevy to simplify build process and make debugging easier. As a result of porting, it does not use much Bevy functionality for now (Mostly just file-loading and multiple platform support).

Play the original version at [http://tic80.com/play?cart=3193](http://tic80.com/play?cart=3193)

* Z: Activate
* X: Inventory / Cancel
* M: Toggle debug info
